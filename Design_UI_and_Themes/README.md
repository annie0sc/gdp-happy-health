# Introduction to UI/UX Design Proposal
UI / UX is a fast growing field that is quickly expanding across organizations and evolving into the development of new niches. User Experience Design, User Interface Design, Customer Experience, and Product Design all frame the larger landscape of building digital content.

This article is a technical onboarding document that can help you write your own UX Plan. It captures the detailed structure and syntax that we use.
# Project Overview
# Roadmap

A UX/UI roadmap is a significant level review of the plans and objectives identifying with an item's user experience, user interface, and user research. Product/item groups utilize these roadmaps to keep convenience a main concern at each phase of advancement. 

- Why to create a roadmap ?

As day by day customers' expectations increase continuously, product groups need to consider the user's experience into account in all of their product decisions.

- Benefits :

1. Helps to prioritize the user experience at every stage of the development.
1. Helps to check the updates.
1. Helps in reinforcing the importance of design and usability. 

# Scope Of Work for UX Design Services
## Prototyping
Software prototyping is much the same as prototyping in the border product design field. It is a necessary step involved in daily software design. Normally, after doing enough UX research like gathering idea, data, information, demands, evaluation, then it’s time to build a prototyping.

It’s similar to the border term prototyping, a way for the manufacturer to get know what the final product will look like, so to evaluate how much additional resources could cost.

The basic software stage including:
- Idea Generation
- Demand Generation
- Function and Structure
- Prototyping Stage
- PRD (replaced by prototyping for most occasions)

### Several aspects to consider:
- Cost: How much will you spend?
- Compatibility: Is the tool for Mac or Windows or both?
- Key features: What can it do?
- Learning Curve: How long it takes you to get started?
- Usage pattern: Are you prototyping websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, or all of the above?
- Speed: How quick can you finish design on the prototyping tool?
- Fidelity: What is the requirement of your prototypes fidelity? Wireframes or low-fidelity or high-fidelity?
- Sharing: Collaboration is key when it comes to design. A must consideration.
- User’s feedback: See what others say.

### Key features:
- Fast Interaction
- Fast Design
- Learning curve: The shortest

### Compatibility: Mac, Window, Android, IOS

### Wireframes :
