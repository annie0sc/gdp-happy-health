# Work Planning 

1. On Wednesday, I attended in-person class and in class, Dr. Badami gave us a brief description on the roles to be taken in module 2 and the work to be done. Yesterday, we made a group call to discuss how to co-ordinate and our team lead also shared the information about the meeting conducted with the Sprint team. We shared our interested roles with each other and I gave a description about roadmap to UI.
