# Half-Day 1 (09/07/2020)

 As it was Labor Day, we had a paid leave given by the management. I had read through the requirements for the next module and was gathering information about the UI development plan.

# Half-Day 2 (09/09/2020)

I had attended a debriefing session conducted by our mentor, Dr. Badami on the new module. I had also volunteered to maintain the common repository for the whole class. I had spent the majority of the day gathering everyoneâ€™s GitHub user IDs and including them as collaborators.

After the Zoom meeting for the leaders, our team lead had assigned us roles and tasks and we created a folder in the repository to hold all our information.

 

# Half-Day 3 (09/11/2020)

I had attended a zoom meeting with our mentor at 8 am for clarifying the progress of the work being done so far.

Following another group conference call, I had picked the topic, bowser compatibility to work on.
