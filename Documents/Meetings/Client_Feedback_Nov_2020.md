UI Mockups Initial Feedback from Prof. Badami
## Summary
Feedback from Dr. Beemer regarding video from 10/30:
- I need to see more about the working aspect of the app.  Water, sleep, step count etc. 
- I do not remember discussing the calorie calculator. Maybe we did.. (it’s been awhile). Can you explain that more?  What happened to the meditation time?  Remember, we had not yet solidified on a “name” for that, but it is important.  I had asked you to brainstorm about a better name at the beginning of this.  (me time, relaxation, meditation, self help, journaling…something that reflects they are taking time to unwind. 
- What is “categories”?  
- What happened to fruits and veggies or anything about food?
- How advanced would it need to be to sync to devices to do steps?  Just curious. 
- What happens if you do not hit your goal? 
- What is the difference in goal and target?  This seems redundant.  Is goal for the user and Target for admins in challenges?  If this is from the admin side, then the Target should be called “Group Target” or “Challenge Target”…Having a different target from a personal step goal can be a motivation issue mentally. Can administrative targets for each action be on a different “page”.  So, have a Group Challenge page and it would have targets for each action just on that page?  This way, personal goals would be different from group activities.  Maybe you can come up with a different thought/plan too. 
- For personal goal setter, is there a section in the app that shows how many they completed vs how far from their goal they are?  Same for the administrative target….is there anything comparing what they received vs what they need to get for the target.
- I want to see what entering the date looks like.  I think you said it was still in development.  I want to ensure it is a calendar pick vs just typing in a date. 
- I like the My Challenges page.  I think this can be linked somehow to what I was previously referring to a different “target/challenge” page not with the personal goals. 
- I don’t understand the “yes/no” of the More Challenges.  Is “yes’ supposed to be “join the challenge”?  
- Success rates?  How would this be different than Group Statistics?
