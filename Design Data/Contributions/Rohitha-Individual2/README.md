For Half day1, I have attended in person class and discussed about our workflow with Dr. Badami. We have discussed about the ER diagrams, sample data and SQL queries. We noted the points told by him, and notes was submitted by our team lead.
We have been assigned some tasks in Jira by sprint planning team and I have started working on them.
