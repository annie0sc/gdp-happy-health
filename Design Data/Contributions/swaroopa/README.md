- So Instead of starting  sprint 1 , our instructor meeted with all scrum masters and sub group leaders, In which thier talked about current draft of the UI mockup
- As, I am not involved in the mockup, I individually examined all of my sprint 0 tasks that was assigned to me by sprint groups and I done with all tasks of sprint 0
